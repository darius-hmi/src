This API will be the production version of the WebApp API but just for Exercise.

The plan is to get a mobile app up and running which then can be used by myself and other friends.

Structure of the app:
	
	Simple login
	
	Exercise type: Cardio, Weighlifting
		if Cardio then:
			type of cardio
			Difficulty
			duration
			maybe the number of calories burnt
		
		if weightlifting:
			Choose which muscle group or whether it is cross training
			Then the exercises for each muscle group
			Reps 
			sets
			weights
		
		Calender view
		Possibilities to add notes
		
		
	
	Would be nice to have features:
		
		Rest timer
		offline mode
		
		
	
	this is the basics of the app, get this running then we can work on some simple analysis
