This is a Django web app that I am curretly in the process of developing, so far I have added the following features:
  - posting
  - messaging users and having a record of the conversation
  - adding food to the current day or any day in the past, and viewing each day's total calories and protein intake
  - adding exercises and viewing each day's exercises
  - adding to do lists and receving a reminder email when the deadline is one day away

Most of these features are functional but there are areas that not a lot of testing has been done, this is a work in progress and not production ready
