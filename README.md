These are some of my projects that I have worked on in the past few months. 

The main project would be the football match prediction located in DeepLearning/FootballPredictors.
There are two versions, version 1 I scrape the website myself within the Data folder and put the features together. In version 2 I use already cleaned data.
I try to work on both versions simultaneously so both models should be updated.

Other notable projets are the Flappy bird game and an AI version of it where it will play it forever.

Also, one of my first ever projects is a web app that can be used to track calories and exercises.
